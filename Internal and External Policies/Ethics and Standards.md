# Ethics and Standards

> Our full Ethics policy is not completed yet - please accept this rough draft in the mean-time. Any questions regarding this is welcome and we would like to encourage you to open an issue on GitHub to address this document.

> We need an outline of topics that are important to the community. ^NV

## Conflicts of Interest

> Very rough start - needs to be reworked. May not be important. Too specific to curators. Some of this blurs the line between a full disclosure policy and an internal policy of how we handle our staff. ^MD

We have a strict policy of Full Disclosure with our staff, contributors, and associates - hereby referenced to as "curators". All curators are to adhere to this policy. Next Player Up recommends the following guidelines be followed to promote a healthy online community:

1. Complete & maintain a biography page that fully divulges any and all ties to the industry. This includes personal and professional ties, interests, and involvements. **Required**
2. For all published content the curator should prominently display conflicts of interest that fall within the scope of said content. Although all possible conflicts will be listed on the biography page, we believe it's in the best interest to list, again, specific conflicts related to the specific work. **Required**
3. Curators should review their biography page periodically. We suggest that curators review prior to a new work is published. **Recommendation**
